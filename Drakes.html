During The Age of Grandeur experiments were conducted on several fronts to try to domesticate dragons or derive a new creature that could be trained. While many arcanists and adventurers perished in the attempts, the experiments ultimately proved fruitful. They resulted in the generation of drakes. Their obedience came at the cost of their power, magic, intelligence, and size, being reduced to large, aggressive, fortified lizards. Mostly used as guardians of domiciles and laboratories, drakes came in three varieties: black/carbon, green/copper, and red/iron. These drakes are completely oxidized very early as their scales are not magically protected like the real dragons.    </body>
