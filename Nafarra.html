Emmanuel Nafarra was a <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Knights%20of%20Dark%20Sun.html" class="wikidpad">Knight of Dark Sun</a></span> who traveled the land preaching the words of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tiering.html" class="wikidpad">Urreli</a></span> to the scattered and broken Dunlaye. When he came riding to the coast the people rejected his aide. They said that they were forbidden to deal with outsiders by the decree of Gapilide, a sorcerer who exercised his power over the disparate people. Gapilide was cruel to the people and would curse them for the smallest of slights, he ruled through fear and did not relieve their suffering. Emmanuel went to Gapilide’s tower to convince him to change his harsh policies, with secret hope to recruit him to the dying Dark Sun. Gapilide said that Emmanuel could travel the land but not interfere with any of the peasants and refused all offers of cooperation. Displeased with the sorcerer’s attitude, Nafarra began to raise contempt against him across the land. Soon he had a rebellion formed to march upon Gapilide’s tower. But when the battle began it was revealed that the goliaths had betrayed Emmanuel, for the promise of wealth and positions of power. Emmanuel and his squire Lugo were forced to flee, Gapilide pursued them to where the coast met the foothills of Ko’s Chain. Nafarra stumbled upon the ancient, hidden jade palace of Recrem whose disguising magic had been extinguished by the Calamity. In those dust covered halls the two paragons fought and just when it seemed that Nafarra was going to be killed he picked up a jade shield that absorbed the magic bolt Gapilide flung at him. Using this shield Nafarra was able to close the distance to the sorcerer and strike the fatal blow. Emmanuel then went to a grand altar in the palace, where Urreli gave him a holy mandate to establish his just kingdom. Emmanuel took it upon himself to build a society that would rightly punish the goliaths who sought a shortcut to prosperity via betrayal. The jade shield of Recrem (the jade wizard king of olde) became an enduring symbol of rightful rulership in Nafarra. Due to its cultural importance, when House Gallante made their play to seize rulership from House Nafarra they spent large sums of money and effort to steal the shield. Despite their successful heist, before they could rally public and private support using the shield, the majority of House Gallante were executed for treason. The Shield of Recrem was never recovered after the rebellion was put down, and remains lost.<br class="wikidpad" />
