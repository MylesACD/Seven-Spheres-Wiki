Technical Name: Polypodiophyta Feyelintum<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Common Names: frond, fern, swamp<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A rare and difficult to grow species of fern coming from Gloam Carr, the fronds of Feyelintum are prized for their psychoactive properties. Generally, the fronds are ground then smoked while fresh or dried to be made into tea. The drug is slow acting and mild by comparison to the plethora of substances that mortals ingest. Frond induces a feeling of relaxation in the user, calming them and slowing their reactions. This property gives it widespread popularity and a generally positive reception. At the same time frond also induces a temporary clarity, where the user becomes more focused on whatever task they were performing when the psychoactive effects take hold.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The quality/sub-type of a frond is determined by the spores on its underside. High quality frond has spores that are dark brown rather the less mature reddish-brown and the spores spread in a thin coat across the entire underside instead of small clumps. While the spores are needed to assess the frond, if not removed before consumption they create a very poor taste and nullify the psychoactive properties. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Frond is considered by most to be safe, but if large amounts are used at once it can lead a comatose state.<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h1280" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Mechanical Effects</h4>
smoking activation delay: 10 minutes <br class="wikidpad" />
tea activation delay: 40 minutes<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Mechanically frond comes in two different levels of quality: high(2) or low(1).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The user's passive perception goes down by 2 times the quality.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Low quality: User cannot take reactions.<br class="wikidpad" />
High quality: User cannot take bonus actions or reactions.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Choose a number of skills or tools equal to the quality, the user has advantage on those checks for the duration.<br class="wikidpad" />
