█████ ████████ ███ █ ██████<br class="wikidpad" />
The yetkilii are some of the most powerful creatures across all the spheres of Ethos, the strongest of which can rival demon lords or jotun jarls. Yetkilii were the last extraplanar creatures to be created by Quultar alone. They come in several subspecies that generally relate to different substances, but each with their own biology and unique magic.<br class="wikidpad" />

After the Second Great Seal the jot had mastered their new home of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Jotunheim.html" class="wikidpad">Jotunheim</a></span> and with the forbiddance binding them there made stronger, they grew idle and began to forget their once advanced magics. Quultar saw this and was displeased so they fashioned the yetkilii as a new challenge for the forgetful jot, and introduced them as native creatures to Jotunheim. Battle between jot and yetkilii has been raging for centuries, only pausing to mutually crush occasional demon invasions. This rivalry did not prove sufficient to prevent the decay of jot into a more primitive version of themselves. Yetkilii are affected by the forbidances in the same way as the jot, thus there are relatively few of them in Mortus. <br class="wikidpad" />

In their own tongue "yetkilii" means those with authority, as they see themselves above and to an extent seperate from all the other species, though this does not preclude them from compassion. "ilii" is a suffix meaning people/group/species. "dar gorilii" is their word for mortals, meaning short sighted. To mortals they are widely known as dragons, coming from the ancient Orthosian dialect.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Quultar first created nine yetkilii, five of them shared their metal-like scales as a common characteristic leading to the grouping of "madenilii" and "Zerrailii" (metal and dust respectively), of which the madenilii are much more formidable. They refered to themselves as such for centuries until new fae, infernal, and demonic variants evolved. To distinguish themselves from their forgein kin the nine named themselves the "Temelilii" meaning God's people. Fae dragons are called "cevikilii" simply translating to fae dragons. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The jotun word "wyrm" is often erroneously used by mortals to refer to all yetkilii; the real meaning is the highest rank of dragon which will mother the next generation. Another key characteristic of wyrms is the concentration of the adamantium in their bones, which with extreme age approaches 100%. Wyrms are so mighty that only maeldölilii(people that spawned from <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Jot.html" class="wikidpad">Mael</a></span>, jotgeroy) have a chance of slaying them. <br class="wikidpad" />

<b class="wikidpad">Oxygen:</b> Oxy dragons, sometimes called sky dragons or cloud dragons, are almost lion-shaped, with wings that look similar to clouds and elephant-like tusks. Oxy dragons breathe high concentrations of ozone, despite being colorless it’s very noticeable due to its burnt metal smell. The gas causes irritation and suffocation, damaging lungs. The most dangerous part of the ozone breath is any possible source of combustion will cause explosions and massive fires. While the ozone doesn’t pose a large threat to other dragons, it does slow them down and rust their scales, giving oxy an edge in melee. Of the five Madenilii: Cobalt, Titanium, Iron, Copper, and Bismuth, only bismuth dragons' hide can not be permanently corroded by Oxygen dragon breath. Titanium gets darker, cobalt changes from silvery to blue, iron mostly turns rusty red, and copper to patina. Wyrms wear their corrosion with pride as a mark of their age.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Copper:</b> Copper dragons, also called bronze, sea, green, or brass dragons, are at the top of Dürende. The higher on the hierarchy the more “tesir” a dragon has, a form of socio-arcane currency that dragons exchange amongst themselves and other phylums. Copper dragons hold their position of authority due to their breath weapon (lightning) is super effective against all the other dragons. They are slower than titanium and sulfur, weaker than titanium and iron, and less arcane than  bismuth, but one strike of their lightning can be devastating. Copper dragons are the most sympathetic species towards mortals, and the only ones they deem worth engaging with after the calamity. Coppers’ fondness for mortals is what has held back the more tyrannical dragons like arsenic, titanium, and iron from conquering Mortus. Due to their good nature they are often in conflict with other dragons, and are continuously having to defend their place on top of Dürende. Copper dragons like to make their lair near the sea, enjoying the wet sea breeze. The notion of green dragon comes from copper wyrms whose scales have been corroded from high atmosphere flying and bouts with oxygen dragons, developing patina patches.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Arsenic:</b> These dragons are mostly grey with bright green accents, mostly at the tips of various metallic juts. Their breath weapon is a spray of liquid arsenic which is poisonous and can melt through metal. They can switch between a wide mist or concentrated hose. They are the second weakest of all dragon species.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Iron:</b> Iron dragons start looking like pure iron, but as they age their skin and scales slowly oxidize, becoming a rusty-red color, usually being called red dragons. These are classic fire breathing dragons. They have 4 lizard-like legs, long tail and neck, and wide wings.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Carbon:</b> Dirge Dragon, collect bones of dragons<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Bismuth:</b> TODO<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Cobalt:</b> The most primitive of all the dragon species and very aggressive has earned the cobalt dragons a reputation as animalistic. Lacking in magical and physical prowess they have low tesir and are often very reclusive. Cobalt dragons start with white scales, which oxidize to a deepblue. Due to their frost breath not being effective against the Jotsnjor, those giants were able to use their runic magic to create wyverns, a tameable version of the great creatures.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Sulfur:</b> Sulfuric dragons are mostly yellow with black accents, mostly at the tips of various metallic juts. Their coloration has given them the common name of yellow dragons. Sulfuric are the smallest of the dragons, they are neither physically powerful nor have a particularly effective breath weapon, but make up for it with their incredible flight speed as the fastest of all dragons. Sulfuric dragons basically spray mustard gas. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Titanium:</b> The largest and most imposing of all dragons, they have a silvery appearance when young which darkens and becomes more translucent as they mature. This causes mortals to sometimes mistake them for iron dragons when young and carbon later. Titanium dragons have the most legs of the Temelilii, having six strong limbs and large wings. Titanium dragons have arguably the weakest breath weapon, but make up for it with extreme strength and speed. They are the fastest on land and in flight second only to the sulphuric, and absolutely unparalleled in dragon vs dragon melee. Titanium dragons are cruel and power hungry, if the good-natured copper dragons were not around titanium dragons would rule the world. Another iconic feature of this species is their large front facing horns that extend past their snout.<br class="wikidpad" />
