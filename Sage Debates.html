After the second Great-Seal the night sky of Mortus was now filled bright points of light the humans called stars. These are infact <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Celestials.html" class="wikidpad">Stellar Celestials</a></span>, but at first mortals had several theories on what they were. With wizardry being invented around the same time many of the theories involved conflation of the two: stars were souls of wizards, wizards pulled power from them for magic, or that it was a great illusion. Other theories, mostly put forth by the clergy, revolved more around Quultar or the other gods they now had contact with. The most popular of all the theories was that it was holes in upper reaches of the plane that allowed Quultar to watch over mortals, which in a way was true but not accurate. There was also fear of the stars, worried that they signaled another type of creature to invade Mortus. The question of what the stars were was finally settled by the third great prophet <i class="wikidpad">__placeholdername___</i> called down an entire constellation to purge a city corrupted by <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Black%20Gods.html" class="wikidpad">Exxon'ix</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />

Once it was cemented that they were Stellar the question became why do they move, why in those formations, and why can we see them if they are on another plane?<br class="wikidpad" />

A theory, arising during the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Age%20of%20Grandeur.html" class="wikidpad">Age of Grandeur</a></span>, that anti-physics and wizardry stem from the same mechanism. More specifally that anti-physics is more advanced, proponents argue that meta-magic has similarities to the mental activity of psionics. Opponents of the theory say that psionics working within anti-magic feilds disproves the connection.<br class="wikidpad" />
