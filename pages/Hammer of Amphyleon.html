Amphyleon's father was a smith named Shegret in a moderately sized ground-city who desperately wanted to be a legendary smith, but he knew he didn't have the talent. He planned to have a child and make an infernal pact; he wanted to pledge the child's soul to Phaedros, but one of Lillis' loths informed him he did not have ownership of it. The minor devil changed the deal so that the father signed his soul to Mammo. Shegret quickly had a child, but after Ampheleon's birth, her mother left, disgusted and shocked by Shegret's deception. He raised his Amphyleon with strict discipline and isolation to force her to excel at smithing and weaving. Throughout her childhood and adolescence, Shegret took credit for all of her work and kept her a secret from the world and his prestigious clients.<br class="wikidpad" />

When the great emperor [Gaion Novosel] needed a new weapon to go crusading against the Xors they went to the most renowed weapon maker in the entire Dulane Empire: Shegret. He joyfully accepted and set Amphyleon to work non-stop. She poured all of her knowledge and skill into a legendary killing machine, but he forced her to discard it as he decided more iterations of development were needed to create something perfect. She went through hundreds of iterations, all deemed inadequate by her father, all the while secretly working on her first design. The day came for the emperor to collect the weapon and begin his warpath. Shegret presented the latest weapon, which to the sizeable imperial congregation was rather unimpressive, but he proclaimed it the best weapon he had ever forged. Nonetheless, a feast was held to honor Shegreat, which provided Amphyleon with the opportunity she had been waiting for, tired of being hidden from the world and her accomplishments stolen. She used the weapon to break out of the workshop and interrupt the emperor's test of the lesser weapon against summoned demons. She stole the show, destroying the demons herself. Under scrutiny from the emperor, Shegret confessed but still tried to exaggerate his importance in the process. This earned him an immediate banishment to hell to be with his master, Mammon.<br class="wikidpad" />
