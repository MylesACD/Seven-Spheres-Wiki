Throughout the course of history all intelligent creatures and civilizations have endeavored to store and gather their knowledge, some of these singular repositories became so vast as to transcend their mundane forms; these tomes are the Codices. They are single books, scrolls, tablets, and arcanotech with enough information to fill a library, each on their own specific subject. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A codex is a single persistent object that over centuries has been added to by all kinds of creatures, mostly mortals, and many cultures. Along with their information the Codices are overflowing with arcane power. Not only is each book indestructible (except by the most insane means) and their whereabouts near impossible to investigate, attuning to a codex grants a host of amazing powers.<br class="wikidpad" />
