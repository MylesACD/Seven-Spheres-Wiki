#During The Age of Grandeur the devils and elves of the E.R. created a ritual that could be performed on an individual elf to make them into a progenitor. These mutated elves could receive “pollen” from many more than typical and had very high success rates having children. The children of this progenitors would after a traumatic event in their life “awaken” with a new telepathic bond with their parent and other awakened siblings. These progenitors then disappear into the Astral Sea during the Calamity coming into contact with strong astral currents and truely reality breaking barrak'ix mutated them further, into the form then known as gith. #<br class="wikidpad" />
