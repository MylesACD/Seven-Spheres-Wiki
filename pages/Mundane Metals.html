<a name=".h30" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Platinum</h4>
While platinum is much rarer than gold naturally and harder to mine its comparitive value to gold is brought down by its high mutability which allows for artificial supply.<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h219" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Tin TODO</h4>
Tin is a very low value metal because of its negative magical conductivity, which makes is very difficult to place enchantments upon. <br class="wikidpad" />
Along with its abundance and easy of use, this places tin in a prime position to serve as an everyday material for simple people.<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h499" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Zinc</h4>
Regular zinc is very resistant to transmutation magic and echanting/threading in general. Anodized zinc is one of the most remarkable materials, having the lowest enchantability and lowest mutability of any mundane substance, coupled with very low fluxicity and a relatively low capacity for a metal. Due to these properties zinc has been nicknamed "dead/inert" metal and consequently was chosen as the material to be used for authentication tokens as agreed upon by <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dulane%20Empire.html" class="wikidpad">DE</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Steel%20Hide.html" class="wikidpad">SH</a></span>.    </body>
