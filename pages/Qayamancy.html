<a name=".h0" class="wikidpad"></a><h2 class="wikidpad heading-level2">Qayamancy</h2>
The study study of the magical attributes of rocks, crystal, metals, and gems, excluding organic substances. Comes from the Yetkilii word Qaya meaning rock. Fundamentally, qayamancy is a specific application of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Magic%20%26%20Materials.html" class="wikidpad">Arcanogeometric Analysis</a></span>, going down to the crystal-lattice structure and atomic structure of the material.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h354" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Amber</h4>
Due to its preserving qualities amber is strongly connected to necromancy, and is the desired material for empowering necromantic implements. Due to this association, things that are anti-amber are used on corpses to ward off necromancy, in areas heavily influenced by the Necro-War--basically everywhere north of Klarth Vanr. Poorer and less informed people use orange essence, the better warding agent is pouring seaweed extract--chloroform--over the grave or corpse.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h836" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Jade</h4>
Another precious mineral that is desired for its beauty in addition to its powerful magical use. There are two varieties of jade which have different origins, colors, and magical properties: Pale Jade and Deep Jade. Pale jade is more common and the “weaker” of the two varieties although it serves a more niche purpose of warding against mundane and magical detection. The majority of pale jade mined during the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Age%20of%20Grandeur.html" class="wikidpad">Age of Grandeur</a></span> was used to ward arcane facilities and other secretive places by dispersing small chunks around the premises. Pale jade charms can also be carried by an individual to only hide themselves, a favorite accessory amongst wizards, kings, and thieves alike. Pale jade gets its name from its color being a much less intense green, sometimes bordering on yellow and being significantly more translucent than deep jade.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The rarer and more useful form of jade is named 'deep jade' after its darker-green color and higher opacity than pale jade. Deep Jade's special qaulity is that it can absorb any kind of magic and store the power for later use.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h1917" class="wikidpad"></a><h4 class="wikidpad heading-level4">Sapphire</h4>
Sapphire is the 2nd strongest warding material known, meaning that warding enchantments, which are much more important than the natural physical strength of a material, are amplified and persist much longer than any other gem or metal. Due to being found naturally within Mortus it is much more common than TODO, and has cultural significance. Notably, being the reusable spell component for <i class="wikidpad">Zone of Truth</i> and making up the chains that bind the dismembered body of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anno%20Novis.html#FirstHeretic" class="wikidpad">First Heretic</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
During the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Age%20of%20Grandeur.html" class="wikidpad">Age of Grandeur</a></span> saphire was primarily used for interogations where a person would sit under a 1ft saphire and exeperience intense mental pain if they tried to be decietful. These "blue light" sessions as they were called formed the basis of the legal system of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dulane%20Empire.html" class="wikidpad">Dulane Empire</a></span>, where defendants could be considered guilty until proving otherwise under blue light and there were professional advocates to sway a judge's ruling, as juries were unnecessary.<br class="wikidpad" />
