Elves are monosex, where each individual can provide genetic information to another, and receive themselves, leading to birth. As a consequence elves don’t form couples or have monogamy, instead forming temporary “pods”. These pods typically aren’t permanent and have 3-9 members. Members of the pods don’t all become pregnant during the same time frame, each is on their own schedule. An elf can take genetic information from up to 3 other elves to create a child. Elven fertility is quite low, barely above replacement as they have actual difficulty becoming pregnant.<br class="wikidpad" />

Elven ejaculation takes the form of small light blue pollen that floats out from many emitter-slits located all over their body. Other elves then catch the pollen in their own similar orifices. Their difficulty in becoming pregnant partly stems from the fact that elves are only receptive--fertile so to speak--under certain conditions. These conditions are different from person-to-person but follow in a limited number of broad strokes such as: The phase of Mat Trang, the ambient temperature being within a certain range, the alignment of Mortus and Gloam Carr, the presences of certain plants or animals, and so on. Some of these are much harder for an elf to know than others, but since this trait is not inherited from the parents (maybe from older ancestors, maybe based on conditions at time of birth) who has what trait is not predictable.<br class="wikidpad" />

<b class="wikidpad">Progenitors:</b> During The <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Age%20of%20Grandeur.html" class="wikidpad">Age of Grandeur</a></span> the elves of the E.R. with guidance from █████ █████ ███████ created a ritual that could be performed on an individual elf to make them into a progenitor. These mutated elves could receive “pollen” from many more than typical and had very high success rates having children. These progenitors would then ██████████ ████ ███ ██████ ███ ███ ██████ ███ █████ ███████████████ █████████████ ████████████████ ████████████████████████████████ ██████ ███ █████████. After a traumatic event in their life, children of progenitors “awaken” with a new telepathic bond with their parent and other awakened siblings.    </body>
