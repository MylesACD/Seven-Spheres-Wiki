Mortals who have psychic powers are commonly referred to as talents. Their specific "talent" affords them access to antiphysics. This allows these mortals to change reality in a way totally alien to any magical power. As such, talents can easily perform feats that no wizard can replicate and are unaffected by any anti-magic measures.<br class="wikidpad" />

Wizards are the pinnacle of magical power, mystic research, and arcanetechnology. It is nominally known that a wizard's power is in some way linked to their soul, demonstrated by factum that no mortal species without souls have been observed to produce wizards and when a wizard sacrifices their soul to a demon they lose their previous arcane power entirely. As a result of this soul requirement, only dwarves, uruk, and humans can be wizards. It has also been shown that only a small percentage of the population can be wizards (for unknown reasons), and in the special case of dwarves, wizards will always reincarnate back into wizards. The true source of a wizard's power comes from █ ███████ ██ ████████████ ███████ ██ ███ █████ ███████████████ █████████████ ██████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████ ███████ ██████ ███ ███████████ ██ ███████ ███████ ███ ███ ██ █<span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anno%20Hostis.html" class="wikidpad">Anno Hostis</a></span> ██ ███████ █████ █████████ █████ ██ ████████ █████ ██████ ████ ███████ ██████ ███ █████ █████ ██ ███████████ ██████████ ███████ █████ ████ ███ ████████ ███ ██████ █████ ██████ ████ █████ ██████ ███ ███████ ████ ████████ ██ ████ ██ ███ █████ ████ ███ ███████████ ██ █<span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Magic%20%26%20Materials.html" class="wikidpad">Threading</a></span>,█ ██ █████ ████ ██████ █ █████████ ██████ ███ ██ █ █████████ ████ ████████ ████ ██ ███████. Wizards are commonly referred to as mages, then depending on their specialization are bifurcated into "sages" those who predominantly carry out intense reasearch, and "arcanists" are those that design arcanotech and predominantly weave.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Meta-Magic:</b> As wizards progress in power they begin developing an obsession for an abstract or nonsensical field of study or arcane practice. If they lean into the obsession their magical prowess begins to accelerate, if they reject it they are often referred to as "stunted". Wizards often have contradictory obsessions/theories to one another, <i class="wikidpad">but both can magically demonstrate the correctness of theirs</i>. Despite this paradox, when wizards spend prolonged periods of time with each other they begin to temporarily, and involuntarily, adopt each others obsession. These many oddities have lead some AOG scholars to posit <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Sage%20Debates.html" class="wikidpad">Arcane-Psionic Unification Theory</a></span><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Tar &amp; Channels:</b> A byproduct of wizards (only wizards) using magic is the generation of highly toxic tar in their internal organs, the more magical power used the more tar generated. As tar builds up the wizard experiences worsening symptoms of tar sickness including: coughing of tar or tar leaking, blackening of skin, muscle fatigue, multiple organ failure, dermal seepage, and eventual brain emulsion. Early signs of tar sickness are the most common way the young wizards are identified as they accidentally use magic without restraint. During the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Age%20of%20Grandeur.html" class="wikidpad">Age of Grandeur</a></span> mages in Orthos developed arcane devices, almost always made of various metals, to enhance their magical abilities. The pivotal component of these implants was called a "channel" consisting of several bladed fans inside a circular housing, which provided the majority magical amplification. The exact mechanism of channels is that arcanists found a way to █████ ███ ████████ █████ ████████ █████ ██████████ ███████ █████ █████. Generally implants followed the same structure: a channel located in the chest, stomach, or back with a thin metal conduit running, internal or externally, to an output device on the face or hands. These implants allowed spells to affect larger areas, last longer, go further etc. but at the same increases the wizard's tar production. This lead to the second class of implants: tar expulsion drains/ports. The implants can be made from a variety of materials and inherit various <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Qayamancy.html" class="wikidpad">qayamanic</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Arcanomerology.html" class="wikidpad">arcanomerlogic</a></span> properties. As wizards add more implants their body also begins to grow in unnatural ways: increasing length of limbs, extra fingers or ears, bone expansion, and more.<br class="wikidpad" />
