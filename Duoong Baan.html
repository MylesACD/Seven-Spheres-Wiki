<br class="wikidpad" />
The elemental plane of water is a very dangerous place. In the forgotten ages the plane became contaminated with some acidic/radioactive corruption that transformed what creatures remained. The stars and sun that were once visible became permanently shrouded by dark purple and red storms. The water slightly thickened and turned a turbulent green-brown acid. At all times, the smell of Sulphur overpowers any other smell. Unbeknownst to almost all mortals, the drastic change that has occurred in Du’o’ong Ba’an is due to █████████ █████ ██████████ ██ ███ ██████ ██ ███ ███████. Most intelligent creatures abandoned the realm, settling in the depths of the prime material’s oceans, this is why the greatest aquatic city Athemari is off the coast of Actavia. Occasionally gigantic vectors of ███████ ████████ can be seen ████████ ███████ ███ ████████<br class="wikidpad" />

Due to it being extremely inhosphitable, Du'o'oong Ba'an is difficult to reach as there is little arcane infrastructure to get there and is usually tightly regulated. There are of course spells that allow for planar travel and the ritual to create a gate. Without access to these two methods an adventuring party could go to the great lakes of the underworld and search for a natural [concordance portal]. The less dangerous in terms of opposition but far more unlikely way, requiring much more preparation, is to be swallowed by the Eeldilon. This is no small task but procuring Tarrasques pheromones guarantees success. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In Du’o’ong Ba’an there exists the counterpart of the Eeldilon, the Nakahi. Nakahi is mostly docile and does not attack planar travelers, but if angered Nakahi because a threat in magnitude similar to a demon lord. The only recommendable source of action is quickly leaving the plane.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The main reason for anyone to go to Du’o’ong Ba’an is to collect Scourge material. A powerful amalgamation of acid, Sulphur infused sandstone, and radioactive algae. Lightning is used to break up the scourge amalgamation into its components, which can be reformed using ultraviolet into new objects.<br class="wikidpad" />
