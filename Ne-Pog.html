<b class="wikidpad">Reds n Golds</b><br class="wikidpad" />
I was born on a Gealradh street <br class="wikidpad" />
where the Throngdor drums did beat<br class="wikidpad" />
And those loving Dwarven feet they walked all over us<br class="wikidpad" />
And every single night <br class="wikidpad" />
when me da' would came home tight<br class="wikidpad" />
He'd invite the neighbors out with this chorus<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come out ye reds and golds, <br class="wikidpad" />
come out and fight me like your told<br class="wikidpad" />
Show your wife how you won medals up in Gailluer<br class="wikidpad" />
Tell her how the GRA <br class="wikidpad" />
made you run the hells away<br class="wikidpad" />
From the green and lovely lanes of Ne-Pogger<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come tell us how you slew them old Dunlaye two by two<br class="wikidpad" />
Like the Zombie hordes they were quite the harrow<br class="wikidpad" />
How bravely you faced one with your whole clan and your own son<br class="wikidpad" />
And you hew through all them undead to the marrow<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come out ye reds and golds, <br class="wikidpad" />
come out and fight me like your told<br class="wikidpad" />
Show your wife how you won medals up in Gailluer<br class="wikidpad" />
Tell her how the GRA <br class="wikidpad" />
made you run the hells away<br class="wikidpad" />
From the green and lovely lanes of Ne-Pogger<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come let us hear you tell how you slandered Saint Ninnell<br class="wikidpad" />
When you fought them well and truly persecuted<br class="wikidpad" />
Where are the sneers and jeers that you loudly let us hear<br class="wikidpad" />
When our heroes of sixteen were executed?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come out ye reds and golds, <br class="wikidpad" />
come out and fight me like your told<br class="wikidpad" />
Show your wife how you won medals up in Gailluer<br class="wikidpad" />
Tell her how the GRA <br class="wikidpad" />
made you run the hells away<br class="wikidpad" />
From the green and lovely lanes of Ne-Pogger<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Come out ye reds and golds, <br class="wikidpad" />
come out and fight me like your told<br class="wikidpad" />
Show your wife how you won medals up in Gailluer<br class="wikidpad" />
Tell her how the <br class="wikidpad" />
GRA made you run the hells away<br class="wikidpad" />
